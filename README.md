Remembering how to write Java

## Todo:

 - Remember on List interface:
   - .size() instead of .length
   - .get(0) instead of [0]
 - Testing
   - How to test array or list equality
   - Assert throws, expect exception in Junit 5
 - Null checks everywhere--this is Java after all!
   - Are there any annotations for this in 2024
 - Mockito - remember how
 - New Java 21 collections - SequencedMap
 - Remember to write package declarations
 - Method reference `::` over lambda where possible 
 - Array declaration syntax `String[] { "foo" }` etc
 - Function declaration
 - package private vs public
 - Array iteration - master stream map collect syntax
 - lambda syntax for stream -> map
 - passing function defined elsewhere
 - Array iteration - for in, append to collection
 - Stream and map over k,v in Hashmap
 - Boxed vs Unboxed ints, long, floats, doubles, char, byte
 - appending strings to specify data type
 - type inference - var
   - doesn't work for arrays
   - doesn't work for lambdas
 - New Java string interpolation (preview feature)
